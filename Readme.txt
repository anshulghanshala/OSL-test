I have implemented the banking system in two programming languages.
1) COBOL
2) C

For the first implementation I used the language as from medieval programming period COBOL has been a bnaking language. The syntax is self observing and is readable.
I have not uploaded the code yet as I would prosent it on request. 
The basic floe of my program is as follows:

Greeting message into the bank -> Provision of atms to do transactions with --> user can choose any of deposit, withdrawal, transfer --> At the end of the day the two atms files are sorted --> The sorted files are then merged into a master transaction file

To make outputs clear I have used text files for storing account information, transaction files, sorted files, and finally a merged file.
In the master file after the name of account holder the  first 16 chars are account number and next 6 are password. The following numbers are the account balamce with the appropriate sign. It is close to 2 decimal place.
